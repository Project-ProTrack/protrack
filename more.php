    <p  class="detail">Employees working in a software company face many issues regarding the tracking, conduction and coordination of their projects.
         Lack of timely tracking, assessment, evaluation and reviewing are some of the major reasons for the issues faced by them.
          Many of the companies find it difficult to deliver the product within the allotted time due to lack of proper tracking and analysis.</p>
      <p    class="det"> Project Tracker is a software application designed entirely for software companies and enterprises to track their projects and
         complete it within a given time. Through this application we aim to provide the users a work progress report on a daily basis
          for software companies. This application allows managers and employees to allocate work and finish/release work/project 
          in the given time.  The time consumed or allocated for completing each task/project of the company will be
           updated to the database.
